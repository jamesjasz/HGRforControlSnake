Overview
HGRforControlSnake is a Python-based computer vision project that captures hand gestures via webcam and uses a CNN model to control a Snake game in real time. It merges classic gameplay with modern gesture-based input methods for an engaging, hands-free experience

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jamesjasz/HGRforControlSnake.git
cd HGRforControlSnake
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run gesture-recognition module
Execute the script designed to detect gestures and map them to controls (e.g. coba10c.py).

Run the Snake game
Launch the in-repo Snake game using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python SnakeFun.py
Make gestures in front of your webcam
Detected gestures will simulate game key presses (up, down, left, right).

Gesture Recognition Details
The system detects hand movements via webcam using HSV color-space filtering, then processes contours and directionality. A Convolutional Neural Network classifies gestures which PyAutoGUI translates into keystrokes to control the Snake game automatically
